### How to Choose
Review the options below and then submit your top three choices. The committee sizes mean that everyone will not be able to be on their first choice of committee, or potentially any committee at all depending on the response. Take a look at these carefully and consider your commitments this semester versus the duration of work for each committee and the kind/amount of work. If you have any questions let us know.

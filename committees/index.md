### How to Choose
Review the options below and come to class with your top three choices. The committee sizes mean that everyone will not be able to be on their first choice of committee. We will try to make sure everyone gets their top choice, but certain committees cannot have 20 people working on them. Take a look at these carefully and consider about your commitments this semester versus the duration of work for each committee and the kind/amount of work.
